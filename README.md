# Overview
Install, configure and manage the Bridge exporter infrastructure


## Create resources

1. Deploy the infrastructure to AWS.  The stack-name parameter should be $STACK_NAME-$ENVIRONMENT (example: bridge-exporter-develop).

```
pip install sceptre
export TRAVIS_BRANCH=develop
source env_vars && source env_vars.secret
sceptre --var "profile=bridge.dev.travis" --var "region=us-east-1" launch-env develop
```

The above should setup infra resources for the app.  Once the infrastructure for app has been setup
you can access and view the resources using the AWS console[1].


## Continuous Integration
We have configured Travis to deploy CF template updates.  Travis deploys using
[sceptre](https://sceptre.cloudreach.com/latest/about.html)

## Secrets
We use git-crypt[2] to hide secrets.  Access to secrets is tightly controlled.  You will be required to
have your own GPG key[3] and you must request access by a maintainer of this project.
